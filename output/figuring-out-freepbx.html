    <p><strong>Note: This post was originally published on iamianwright.com it's been moved here for archival purposes.</strong></p>
<p>In a moment of clarity I realised I was massively overcomplicating how to go about directing calls.  I had wanted the PBX to know if I was out of the house and route calls to the extension on my iPhone instead of my Mac.  When I thought about it this evening I realised that's completely unnecessary as FreePBX lets you set a rule for what to do if an extension is unreachable.  So I have now set it up so that if the softphone on my Mac isn't signed in then the call forwards to the extension for my iPhone.</p>
<p>On the subject of the iPhone, it turns out there are a number of SIP clients out there.  I've tried a few of them but so far the most reliable one has been <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/3cxphone-voip-sip-softphone/id392927995?mt=8" title="3CXPhone / VoIP / SIP Softphone for iOS">3CXPhone</a> as it has the ability to accept calls in the background and when the device is on standby.  The only downside is that the ringtone is Marimba which I can't stand and sadly there is no option to change it.</p>
<p>It's all coming together quicker than I expected but there are still a few things to tick off:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Setup a VPN so I can connect externally.</li>
<li>Configure the PBX to only allow calls through between 9am and 5pm Monday to Friday.  All other calls should go to voicemail and the messages forwarded to my email account.</li>
<li>Record better messages for any of the greetings or menus I'll be using rather than the robotic American voice currently being used.</li>
</ul>
