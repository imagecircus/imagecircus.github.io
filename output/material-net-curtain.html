    <p>I'm currently working on modelling the whole interior of the house my wife and I are buying. I'm one room in so far but I'll cover that in detail in another post soon. I hit a snag when I was trying to model the curtains for the windows though.</p>
<p>How on earth do you make a net curtain material?</p>
<p>I tried using the translucent material, then I tried using it mixed with the transparent material but nothing seemed quite right. I had a brief chat with Alex Saplacan on the UK &amp; Ireland Blender Users Slack group and he suggested using Wave Texture nodes to generate the lines in the fabric. After some fiddling about I came up with this which I think works pretty well.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="img/Net-Curtain-Cycles-Material-Nodes.png"></p>
<p>Applying it to a plane that I'd distorted using the cloth simulation gave a pretty believable result…</p>

<p>…and up close you can see the very fine fibres.</p>

<p>Hopefully someone out there will find this useful. I hope to share more materials as I make them throughout this project. I might also have to think about changing the design of this site to make it easier to find them once there's a decent library.</p>
