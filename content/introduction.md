## Why am I writing?

I wanted a new project, I have an interest in the web and I wanted to improve my writing. I had been thinking about learning a new programming language for a while and it occured to me that perhaps I could do that and write about it as I went along.

I mentioned the idea to one of the Ruby developers at work. I was fairly sure that as I'm a newb I would have nothing useful or interesting to say. His response inspired me to write everything on this site. He said, "There is always someone that started learning a week after you".

So I plan to spend 2015 learning Ruby and blogging about my experiences. I aim to write at least one post a fortnight but I hope to exceed that. I will post my code to a public github as I go along for others to play with, advise on, improve or maybe even use.

## What have I done?

I have been making websites since I was about thirteen. I started playing around writing HTML in Notepad on the family computer back in the mid-ninties. I received an original iMac in exchange for my first "paid" website about three years later and started taking it a little more seriously from then on.

I have worked as a freelancer on web and graphic design projects on and off around day jobs since then. I have a design company called [Image Circus](http://www.imagecircus.com "London based web development agency") and still take on occasional projects when time allows.

Primarily I have built sites on top of WordPress, Drupal and Concrete5. The projects mainly involved a lot of front-end design and leaving the CMS to do the heavy lifting.

Last year I decided to roll up my sleeves and learn PHP. After about eighteen months I got to a place where I felt quite comfortable with the basics and confident that I could find my way through the things I didn't know as they arose. I built an eCommerce site, a gallery for my wedding photos and a tool to generate avatars from minecraft usernames.

I learned from Treehouse, a couple of books and a lot of googling. Handily my brother is a senior developer and despite living across the pond he gave me plenty of advice and suggestions to improve my code. I am also priviledged to work with an amazingly talented bunch of designers and developers. All of whom have helped me out with various questions along the way.

## Who am I?

> "He's just zis guy, you know?" Gag Halfrunt

I'm a recent immigrant to the capital from the wilds of Kent. I work in a non-technical role for an awesome [public sector web agency](http://www.dxw.com "Public sector web that works") near the hallowed roundabout. I get to meet all sorts of interesting people that I had never expected to work with and I get to have meetings in some of the most awesome buildings in London. Most importantly I believe that the work we do makes a difference and it feels good to be involved in improving the public sector for everyone.

In my spare time I like to tinker with code and occasionally electronics. I'm interested in multirotors and the potential applications of aerial platforms. I also love video games but rarely find time to play them.

I'm married and live with my wife and our two cats in North London.
