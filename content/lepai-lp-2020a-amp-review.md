My new Lepai LP-2020A+ amp arrived yesterday and I promised a quick review so here goes.  I expected it to be adequate at best but it's excellent!  I am not an audiophile but I can definitely appreciate the difference between good and bad audio.  The only complaint I have is that the amp does sound a bit muddy if you switch on the tone controls so I have left them disabled.  It's not much of a concern though as I'm streaming the audio from iTunes so I'm using the built in equaliser and it sounds great.

For less than thirty quid I cannot praise the [Lepai LP-2020A+](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B007VMA6OU/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 "Lepai TA2020+ on Amazon.co.uk") enough.  As I already had the speakers and Airport Express it's a no-brainer.
