Title: About IDW

Hi, I'm Ian Dow-Wright.

I've had a variety of jobs over the years, web development, graphic design, creative training, lecturing, etc. Currently I'm helping a team develop a multi-brand, multi-platform Design System for a large banking group.

I'm married and live with my wife, our daughter and our cat on the Kent coast, in the southeast of England.

In my (increasingly rare) spare time I enjoy 3D modelling and 3D printing and I've become quite involved with the [blender](https://www.blender.org/) community as a result. I also like coding for fun (php, python, react) and I'm interested in home automation. Away from the computer I'm also pretty keen on making, recently I've been getting into both leather working and wood working.
