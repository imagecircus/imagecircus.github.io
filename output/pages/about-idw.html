    <p>Hi, I'm Ian Dow-Wright.</p>
<p>I've had a variety of jobs over the years, web development, graphic design, creative training, lecturing, etc. Currently I'm helping a team develop a multi-brand, multi-platform Design System for a large banking group.</p>
<p>In my spare time I enjoy 3D modelling and 3D printing and I've become quite involved with the <a href="https://www.blender.org/">blender</a> community as a result. Away from the computer I'm also pretty keen on making, recently I've been getting into both leather working and wood working.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly I also enjoy tinkering with code and electronics. I'm pretty proficient, though rusty, in php but now I'm writing more python and learning react.</p>
<p>I'm married and live with my wife, our daughter and our cat on the Kent coast, in the southeast of England.</p>
<p>More regular updates can be found on <a href="https://twitter.com/iandowwright">twitter</a>.</p>
