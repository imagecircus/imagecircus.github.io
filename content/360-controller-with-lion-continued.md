Following on from yesterday, I downloaded Borderlands from the Mac App Store along with Half-Life 2 Episode 1, Half-Life 2 Episode 2, Portal and Portal 2 from Steam.

Borderlands worked immediately with the 360 controller. A good start.

Portal 2 also worked straight away but sadly none of the other Steam games recognised the controller.  I tried the exec 360controller command in the developer console but that didn't make any difference either. Having done more reading online it appears that the Mac version of Steam doesn't support gamepads with the source games. [An article written in May 2010](http://www.macrumors.com/2010/05/09/first-impressions-of-steam-for-mac-including-portal-and-team-fortress-2/ "An article written in May 2010") mentions:

> Gamepad support, despite it being listed in the options menus for games, is not something the beta has. I was told by Valve earlier that this support is definitely on their to-do list.

Unfortunately it looks like that may not happen as it has now been a year and a half since the article was written and it's still missing. I suppose it comes down to the fact that Half-Life 2 is now over eight years old so it predates the xbox 360, Steam and Lion. I'll keep my fingers crossed that someone will work their magic and make these things talk to one another but I think the chances are slim.
