    <p><strong>Note: This post was originally published on iamianwright.com it's been moved here for archival purposes.</strong></p>
<p>I bought some Mordaunt Short Avanti 902i's to use as rears for a surround sound set several years ago but have only ever had one living room large enough to accommodate the whole setup.  As we now have a large swedish shelving system in our home office I was hoping to finally be able to use these bookshelf speakers that have been nestled in their box for the last four years.</p>
<p>Ideally I wanted to be able to stream to them from iTunes and iOS devices.  As they are passive speakers I knew I would require an amp and I was hopeful that by now network streaming might be a fairly standard feature.  Sadly this is not the case, at least not in the section my budget would stretch too.</p>
<p>Above right is the Denon stack a DNP720AE Network Music Player atop a PMA520AE Stereo Amp.  When I first saw the Denon streamer I misunderstood it to be a self contained amp with network connections.  Unfortunately for nearly £200 this device only generates an unamplified signal so it still requires the amp below before it can power speakers. Interestingly Denon do make a single device solution in the form of an AV receiver - an amp that deals with video as well as audio - that includes wireless streaming for around the £260 mark.</p>
<p>Sadly everything I looked at was still way beyond my budget and it became apparent that there is no such thing as a cheap Hi-Fi amplifier.  <a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/Amplifiers-Pre-Amps-/14970/i.html" title="Amplifiers for sale on eBay">Even on eBay old amps go for upwards of £100</a>.  After much searching I came across a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B007VMA6OU/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1" title="Lepai TA2020+">mini amplifier</a> on Amazon for the princely sum of £26.99!  It's called a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B007VMA6OU/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1" title="Lepai TA2020+ on Amazon.co.uk">Lepai TA2020+</a> and it has surprisingly good reviews.  I called in an old Airport Express that I had loaned out to a friend and I am now eagerly awaiting delivery of this tiny amp.  I will let you know <a href="http://iamianwright.com/2013/05/11/lepai-amp-review/" title="Lepai Amp Review">how this budget option turns out</a>.</p>
