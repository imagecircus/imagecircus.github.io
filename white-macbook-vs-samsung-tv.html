<p>A few years ago I bought my parents a Samsung TV as a Christmas present.  Recently they have started watching more content on their laptop and my Mum asked if there was a way to connect it to the TV for easier viewing.  They have a somewhat ageing MacBook, the white plastic model (long since discontinued) which has a Mini DVI output.  So we purchased a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Apple-Mini-adapter-cable-Neet®/dp/B001PLIS6Q/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1359664907&amp;sr=8-1">Mini DVI to HDMI adapter</a> and some <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Dcomputers&amp;field-keywords=hdmi+cable+2m">HDMI cables from amazon</a> and with my Mother being a slight technophobe I was invited over to "set it up".</p>
<p>For anyone reading this you'll be thinking exactly what I was, plug the cables in, select the HDMI input and Robert's your Dad's brother.  This is exactly what happened when I plugged it into the small, cheap TV in their bedroom.  However the larger, more expensive Samsung TV in their living room refused to behave itself.  I tried various menus on the television to no avail.  I googled the problem with every keyword combination I could think of and eventually gave up.</p>
<p>The MacBook was clearly recognising it was plugged into an external display as the screen flashed as it should but the TV stubbornly continued showing the No Signal message.  I admitted defeat and headed home.</p>
<p>A considerable amount of searching later I found <a href="http://www.avsforum.com/t/1219357/no-signal-on-samsung-ln52b750-from-macbook-air">this post on the AVS Forums</a> which seemed to describe a similar issue.  Fortunately I had access to a PC laptop that offered an HDMI out so I visited my parents again and gave it a go.  Success!</p>
<p>The TV detected the PC's output immediately.  I changed the Picture Size to Screen Fit as directed, disconnected the PC and then connected the MacBook which then worked faultlessly.</p>
<p>I have written this here in the hope of directing anyone else encountering the same problem to this hard to find gem of information.  It's a very peculiar issue but armed with the instructions and a Windows laptop it is solved in minutes.</p>
