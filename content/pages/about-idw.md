Title: About IDW

Hi, I'm Ian Dow-Wright.

I've had a variety of jobs over the years, web development, graphic design, creative training, lecturing, etc. Currently I'm helping a team develop a multi-brand, multi-platform Design System for a large banking group.

In my spare time I enjoy 3D modelling and 3D printing and I've become quite involved with the [blender](https://www.blender.org/) community as a result. Away from the computer I'm also pretty keen on making, recently I've been getting into both leather working and wood working.

Unsurprisingly I also enjoy tinkering with code and electronics. I'm pretty proficient, though rusty, in php but now I'm writing more python and learning react.

I'm married and live with my wife, our daughter and our cat on the Kent coast, in the southeast of England.
